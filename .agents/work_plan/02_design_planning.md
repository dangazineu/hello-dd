# Design & Planning Phase

This phase involves creating a detailed implementation plan with architectural decisions for the distributed system.

## 1. Architectural Analysis

### Service Dependencies
- Map out which services depend on the changes
- Identify upstream and downstream impacts
- Document API contract changes
- Consider backward compatibility requirements

### Distributed System Patterns
Identify which patterns apply to your task:
- **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication
- **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Parallel service calls with aggregation
- **Saga Pattern**: Multi-step transactions with compensations
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance mechanisms
- **Retry with Backoff**: Resilience patterns
- **Async Processing**: Queue-based or event-driven flows

### Trace Propagation Strategy
- Determine how trace context will flow through services
- Plan for correlation ID generation and propagation
- Consider W3C Trace Context headers
- Design for distributed tracing visibility

## 2. Technical Design

### API Design
For each new or modified endpoint:
- HTTP method and path
- Request format (headers, body, query params)
- Response format (success and error cases)
- Status codes
- Validation rules
- Rate limiting considerations

### Data Flow Design
Document the complete data flow:
1. Entry point (usually API Gateway)
2. Service interactions sequence
3. Database operations
4. Cache interactions
5. External service calls
6. Response aggregation
7. Error handling flow

### Error Handling Strategy
- Define error types and codes
- Plan error propagation through services
- Design fallback mechanisms
- Specify retry policies
- Document circuit breaker thresholds

## 3. Implementation Planning

Create `task_work/task_plan.md` with:

### Summary
Brief description of the solution approach

### Components to Modify

#### API Gateway Changes
- Files to modify
- New files to create
- Dependencies to add
- Configuration changes

#### Inventory Service Changes
- Files to modify
- New files to create
- Database schema changes
- Dependencies to add

#### Pricing Service Changes
- Files to modify
- New files to create
- Cache strategy changes
- Dependencies to add

### Implementation Steps
1. Service-specific changes (ordered by dependency)
2. Inter-service communication updates
3. Configuration and environment updates
4. Testing implementation
5. Documentation updates

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- New test files needed
- Test scenarios to cover
- Mock strategies for dependencies

#### Integration Tests
- Inter-service test scenarios
- Database interaction tests
- Cache behavior tests

#### End-to-End Tests
- Complete flow tests
- Error scenario tests
- Performance tests

#### Load Testing
- Endpoints to stress test
- Expected throughput
- Latency requirements
- Resource utilization targets

## 4. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- Breaking changes to APIs
- Service dependency failures
- Performance degradation
- Data consistency issues
- Trace context loss

### Mitigation Strategies
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Backward compatibility layers
- Performance benchmarks
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## 5. Implementation Sequence

Define the order of implementation:
1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality (which service first?)
2. **Phase 2**: Integration points
3. **Phase 3**: Error handling and resilience
4. **Phase 4**: Optimizations
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and validation

## 6. Success Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- All requirements implemented
- Services communicate correctly
- Error handling works as designed
- Data consistency maintained

### Non-Functional Criteria
- Performance targets met
- Distributed traces are complete
- No trace context loss
- Proper error propagation
- Resource usage within limits

### Testing Criteria
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- E2E tests demonstrate correct behavior
- Load tests meet performance targets
- No regression in existing functionality

## Review Questions

Before proceeding, consider:
- Are there simpler approaches?
- Have all edge cases been considered?
- Is the error handling comprehensive?
- Will distributed tracing work correctly?
- Are there security implications?
- Is the solution scalable?

## Key Requirements

- The plan must be specific and actionable
- Each step should be testable
- Consider distributed system complexities
- Plan for observability from the start
- Document assumptions clearly
